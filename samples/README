JANUS functions to serve the user
---------------------------------
o makefile
  here you may select the file you want to compile


o dspdjanus.c, dsymjanus.c, dgnljanus.c, zhpdjanus.c, zherjanus.c, zsymjanus.c,
  zgnljanus.c
  very elementary drivers with an inline sparse matrix that demonstrate
  the basic usage of JANUS for real/non-real matrices (prefix d/z) and its
  structure-preserving C drivers for
  the symmetric(Hermitian) positive definite case (dspd/zhpd),
  the real symmetric/complex Hermitian case (dsym/zher),
  the complex symmetric case (zsym) and
  the general case (dgnl/zgnl)

o janusdriver.c, janusdriver_scaled.c
  main JANUS driver that reads in a matrix in matrix market format,
  demonstrates how to change the options and calls the iterative
  solver without diagonal scaling/with diagonal scaling.

o janusdriver_cpp.cpp
  C++ interface of the JANUS main driver

o bfspaidsym.c, bfspaizher.c, bfspaizsym.c
  approximate matrix inversion via Neumann series using the (symmetric) block
  incomplete LDL^T facorization

o dsymselbinv.c, zherselbinv.c, zsymselbinv.c
  selected inversion using the (symmetric) block incomplete LDL^T facorization


o mmio.h, mmio1.h, mmio.hh, mmio.c
  auxiliary files to read in matrices in matrix market format
  
o *.mtx
  some sample matrices to play around with
