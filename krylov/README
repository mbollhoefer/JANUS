This subdirectory mainly contains some Krylov subspace methods which are used
by default with JANUS. The user may certainly use his/her own most favorite
iterative solvers using the forward/backward solve function of JANUS.

main Krylov subspace routines (most of them are C translations from SPARSKIT,
updated w.r.t. complex arithmetic, BLAS routines, macros) are:

gmres.c pcg.c sqmr.c

some auxiliary routines are located here as well.
