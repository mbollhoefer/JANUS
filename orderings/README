this subdirectory contains subroutines for scaling and reordering the given
matrix. They are taken from the ILUPACK repository.

The categories are as follows

1) perm*.c refer to the nonsymmetric case with nonsymmetric scalings and
   symmetric reorderings (mt-Metis, AMD, RCM, null). If the
   acronym "MC64" is used, then nonsymmetric scaling along with a column
   permutation is applied in advance in order to obtain a diagonal part with
   entries of magnitude 1. After that symmetric reorderings are applied

2) symperm*.c refer to the symmetric case with symmetric scalings and
   symmetric reorderings (mt-Metis, AMD, RCM, null). If the
   acronym "MC64" is used, then symmetric scaling along with a column
   permutation and row permutation is applied in advance in order to obtain a
   block diagonal part with diagonal blocks of size 1x1 and 2x2, hoping that
   the 1x1 entries are of magnitude 1(not guaranteed) and the diagonal blocks
   of size 2x2 have at least two entries of magnitude 1(safe). After that
   symmetric reorderings are applied to the compressed graph, where 2x2 blocks
   are compressed to a single row/column. At the end, the permutation is
   prolongued back to the original size respecting the 2x2 diagonal blocks.
